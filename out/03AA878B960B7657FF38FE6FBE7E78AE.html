<h2>
<i> Jerbeia</i> gen. nov.</h2>
<p> Type species:<i> Jerbeia darkovi</i>
<b> sp. nov.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b> Description. Male.</b> Small-sized clearwing moths with alar expanse about 16–17 mm.</p>
<p> Head with antenna long, reaching apical area of forewing, slightly serrated and ciliated; frons and vertex smooth-scaled; labial palpus long with a few hair-like scales ventrally; proboscis well-developed, long, functional.</p>
<p> Thorax smooth-scaled, with sparse and very short hair-like scales dorsally; both metepimeron and metameron with long hair-like scales posteriorly. Legs smooth-scaled, but posterior margin of all femora covered with long hair-like scales. Forewing (Fig. 15) with well-developed transparent areas and broad discal spot; veins R1–R3 parallel, R4 and R5 stalked for about half of their length; distance between bases of veins R4+5, М1, М2 and М3 nearly equal; cross-vein reduced. Hindwing (Fig. 15) transparent, discal spot broad, cuneiform, reaching the base of common М3–CuA1 stem; veins М3 and CuA1 with short common stalk.</p>
<p> Abdomen smooth-scaled, anal tuft well-developed.</p>
<p>
<b> Male genitalia.</b> Tegumen-uncus complex broad; scopula androconialis well-developed (Fig. 9); crista gnathi medialis and crista gnathi lateralis well-developed, semi-oval (Fig. 9); valva (Fig. 10) trapeziform-ovoid with a ventrally oblique tip, crista sacculi undeveloped, ventral crista armed with a group of strong pointed setae; saccus (Fig. 11) relatively broad, gradually narrowed and rounded basally, long, about 2.5 times longer than vinculum; aedeagus (Figs 12, 13) thin, straight, somewhat longer than valva, vesica with two flat and dentate cornuti (Fig. 14).</p>
<p>
<b> Female.</b> Unknown.</p>
<p>
<b> Differential diagnosis.</b> Superficially, this new genus can be confused with<i> Nesosphecia</i> Bartsch, 2018 (type species:<i> N. mystica</i> Bartsch, 2018), but it clearly differs from<i> Nesosphecia</i> by the forewing venation (veins R1 and R2 fused distally, veins М2 and М3 from common point in<i> Nesosphecia</i>,<i> vs</i>. veins R1–R3 parallel, distance between bases of veins R4+5, М1, М2 and М3 nearly equal in<i> Jerbeia</i>
<b> gen. nov.</b>; cp. Fig. 15 with fig. 29 in Bartsch 2018: 184) and the structure of the tegumen-uncus complex, valva and vesica in the male genitalia (see Figs 9–14 and fig. 27 in Bartsch 2018: 182). From all other genera of the Afrotropical Synanthedonini,<i> Jerbeia</i>
<b> gen. nov.</b> is distinguishable by the structure of the male genitalia, namely, by the presence of a ventral crista of the valva (Fig. 10) and two flat and dentate cornuti of the vesica (Fig. 14). These two characters should be considered as synapomorphies.<i> Jerbeia</i>
<b> gen. nov.</b> is somewhat similar to the Palaearctic genus<i> Dipchasphecia</i> Căpuşe, 1973 (type species:<i> Dipsosphecia roseiventris</i> Bartel, 1912) by the structure of the valva and by the presence of a ventral crista in the male genitalia, but differs by the presence of a crista gnathi medialis (it is absent in<i> Dipchasphecia</i>; cf. Fig. 10 with figs 197–208 in Špatenka<i> et al</i>. 1999) and two flat and dentate cornuti (<i> versus</i> vesica with only a single small cornutus in<i> Dipchasphecia</i>). Besides this,<i> Jerbeia</i>
<b> gen. nov.</b> resembles the Palaearctic genus<i> Chamaesphecia</i> Spuler, 1910 (type species:<i> Sphinx empiformis</i> Esper, 1783), but<i> Jerbeia</i>
<b> gen. nov.</b> is easily separable by the absence of a sclerotized crista of the valva and the shape of cornuti of the vesica in the male genitalia.</p>
<p>
<b> Biology.</b> The larval host plant is unknown. Мoths on wings in October–November.</p>
<p>
<b> Composition.</b> Мonotypic. Only the type species<i> Jerbeia darkovi</i>
<b> sp. nov.</b> is included into this new genus.</p>
<p>
<b> Range.</b> Currently known only from western Ethiopia, Afrotropical.</p>
<p>
<b> Etymology.</b> The name of this new genus derives from first letters of the Joint Ethio-Russian Biological Expedition (JERBE), in the scope of which the author has had the honour to study the fauna of Lepidoptera of Ethiopia. The gender is feminine.</p>
