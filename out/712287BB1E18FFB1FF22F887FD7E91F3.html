<b> Taxonomic history</b>. Gilmour (1963) described his new species in<i> Phormesium</i> Thomson, 1864. Several years later, Martins (1970:923) synonymized<i> Phormesium</i> with<i> Engyum</i> Thomson, 1864 (translated): “The name<i> Engyum</i> has priority over the name<i> Phormesium</i>; the former was established for the female of<i> E. quadrinotatum</i> Thomson (1864: 216), and the latter for the male of<i> eudesmoides</i> Thomson (=<i> fusiferum</i> Serville), (1864: 217).” The correction is regarding the synonymy proposed by Lacordaire (1868), who considered<i> Engyum</i> as a junior synonymy of<i> Phormesium</i>. Still, according to Martins (1970: 929), who provisionally considered<i> P. trinidadense</i> as belonging to<i> Engyum</i> (translated): “The allocation of<i> trinidadense</i> in<i> Engyum</i> is provisional and can only be clarified when it is possible to examine material<i> in natura</i>.” Some conclusions can be extracted from the detailed description: the procoxal cavities “moderately widely open posteriorly” move the species to the Division IV [currently Neoibidionina]. Actually, the kind of pubescence of the pronotum, the number of longitudinal rows of piliferous punctures on each elytron, and the dimensions (10-11.2 x 2.1-2.3 mm) relatively large, appear to exclude it from<i> Engyum</i> and similar genera, despite the shape of antennomere III. Once located in Division IV,<i> trinidadense</i> could be included in<i> Compsibidion</i> and would constitute a separate grouping, next to the group<i> sphaeriinum</i>: upper eyes lobes "rather small and narrow", with three rows of ommatidia; antennomere III thickened and not carinate in the antennae of males. The representatives of this group, however, have sparse pubescent pronotum, prosternum without sericeous pubescence, elytra bispinose and uniform coloring. Finally, Martins (2009: vi) transferred<i> Phormesium trinidadensis</i> to<i> Compsibidion</i> Thomson, 1864 (translated): “<i> Phormesium trinidadensis</i> is transferred to the genus<i> Compsibidion</i> Thomson, 1864, treated in volume nine of this series (Martins &amp; Galileo, 2007). Because it has procoxal cavities open posteriorly, it seems to us more appropriate to transfer it to Ibidionina, and in this subtribe, the most appropriate genus for receiving it is<i> Compsibidion</i>. A more precise transfer, however, will only be possible when the holotype is examined.”</p>
<p> Napp &amp; Martins (1985) described<i> Glomibidion</i> for their new species,<i> G. tumidum</i> (Figs 1–4), from Brazil (Sinop, Mato Grosso).<i> Glomibidion</i> was characterized as follows (translated): “Frons flat; frontoclypeal suture moderately marked. Maxillary palpi slightly longer than labials ones, the apical palpomeres securiform. Antennal tubercles slightly elevated, rounded and distant from each other at the base. Eye normal, the upper eye lobes with four rows of ommatidia. Antennae 11-segmented, longer than body; scape cylindrical, slightly thickened toward apex, without basal sulcus, longer than antennomere IV; the III strongly thickened (male), not carinate; antennomeres IV–XI normal and carinate, the IV distinctly shorter than III and V. Prothorax cylindrical-elongate, slightly constricted basally and distally. Pronotum not microsculptured, shining, with basal tubercles slightly distinct. Elytra shining, without pubescence; punctation and setae restricted to five longitudinal rows of piliferous punctures; apex curved notched, with short spine at outer angle. Femora nearly clavate, without basal depression, unarmed. Tibiae with carinae slightly distinct at basal half.”</p>
<p>
<b> Transference.</b> Reading the original description of<i> Phormesium trinidadensis</i>, it is possible to see the following points that allow the inclusion of the species in<i> Glomibidion</i>: “Elytra glabrous and nitid except for about five sublinear rows of erect ferruginous setae”; “Head with frons a little transverse, with a short median sulcus, extending between antennal tubercles, almost plane, with a strong semicircular sulcus anteriorly, curving round on the inner side of the eyes”; “antennal tubercles rather strongly raised, broadly concave between, widely separated”; “Palpi with apical segments large, broad, strongly obliquely truncate apically”; “Eyes… isthmus to upper lobe about three facets wide”; “Antennae only about a seventh longer than the body; scape rather robust, moderately swollen, moderately long, extending past the pronotal base; third segment extremely enlarged and swollen, subdepressed, about twice as long as scape; fourth segment short, about two thirds as long as scape, about a third as long as third segment; fifth segment about one and three-quarters as long as fourth, slightly longer than scape”; “segments [antennomeres] four to about eight, feebly longitudinally carinate above”; “Pronotum subcylindrical, elongate, one and a half times as long as broad”; “which [elytra] have the marginal angle somewhat attenuate and strongly spinose, inwardly obliquely truncate, sutural angle broadly rounded”; “each elyton [<i> sic</i>] with four rows of widely spaced setigerous punctures on anterior half and five rows on posterior half”; “profemora clavate, the others more gradually subpedunculo-clavate, the posterior least swollen”; “tibiae rather feebly longitudinally carinate above and below.”</p>
<p> Since all these features agree exactly with the original description of<i> Glomibidion</i>,<i> Phormesium trinidadensis</i> should not be excluded from<i> Glomibidion</i>. Additionally, antennomere III in males of<i> Compsibidion</i> are never as thickened as in<i> Glomibidion</i>.</p>
<p>
<b> Remarks</b>. Apparently, the only reliable difference between<i> G. tumidum</i> and<i> G. trinidadense</i> is the size of the anterior pale yellow macula of the elytra. Gilmour (1963) examined two specimens with very broad anterior macula, while Napp &amp; Martins (1985) examined three specimens with proportionally much smaller anterior maculae. Even comparing Gilmour’s detailed description with a paratype of<i> G. tumidum</i> deposited at MZSP collection, we did not find any other consistent differences (see photographs of the holotypes at Bezark 2018). Thus, these two species may eventually be synonymized. Females of both species remain unknown. However, as occurs in other species of Neoibidionini in which the males have the antennomere very tumid, the female probably has narrow and cylindrical antennomere III. Furthermore, as antennomere IV in both species is carinate, antennomere III of the female may also be carinate.</p>
