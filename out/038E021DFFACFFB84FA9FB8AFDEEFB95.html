<b> Taxonomic comments.</b>
<i> Monilesaurus ellioti</i> was described, based on Jerdon’s observation of<i> C. rouxii</i> like animals from “Malabar” in his list of Reptiles of Southern India, 1853 and a collection of drawings of this species in the possession of W. Elliot. Historically, southern Karnataka and northern Kerala have been referred to as Malabar. Boulenger (1885) gave a short description of this species based on the collections made by Col. R.H. Beddome from Anamalai hills, Sivagiri Ghat, Tirunelveli and Malabar. As there are no type specimens associated with this species, we hereby designate a neotype for this species. The selection of the neotype is roughly congruent with the original type locality of this species “Malabar” as mentioned by Jerdon (1853). Murthy (1978) described a subspecies<i> Calotes ellioti amarambalamensis</i> the type locality of which is Amarambalam, Nilambur. The holotype of this species is now at ZSI Madras (ZSI Madras 159) (Das<i> et al</i>. 1998). We were unable to trace the specimen in ZSI collections despite repeated attempts. For now, the specimen may be considered as lost. Hence, we compare another specimen collected from the same locality (BNHS 1033), a female individual whose characters match well with other<i> M. ellioti</i> and the description provided by Murthy. Also, the locality is within the distribution range of<i> M. ellioti</i> and contiguous with the type locality. Therefore, we consider<i> Calotes ellioti amarambalamensis</i> as a junior synonym of<i> M. ellioti</i> (Günther, 1864). ZSI Madras 159 is wrongly mentioned as a type specimen of<i> Calotes ellioti</i> (Uetz &amp; Hošek, 2016).</p>

<b> gen. et sp. nov</b>., and<i> M. rouxii</i>) and presence of a white spot below the eye (vs. absent in<i> M. rouxii</i>; in the form of a band in<i> M. montanus</i>
<b> gen. et sp. nov</b>.) and smaller body size: adult SVL 59.4–73.8 mm, n=9 (vs.<i> C. montanus</i>
<b> gen. et sp. nov</b>., adult SVL 61–83.4 mm, n=8; and<i> M. acanthocephalus</i>
<b> gen. et sp. nov</b>. adult SVL 68.9–72.6 mm, n=3).</p>
<p>
<b> Description.</b> Based on CESL 0 45. A medium sized adult male (SVL- 63.7 mm), Morphometric and meristic data are summarised in Appendix 2 &amp; 3. General habitus moderately compressed. Head moderately large (HL/SVL ratio 0.29), elongate (HW/HL ratio 0.63), maximum height less than maximum width; snout pointed; rostral broader than high; nostrils in single nasal shield, which is separated from rostral by a single scale; mental shield narrower than rostral; two postmentals, first pair in contact with each other; genials keeled; gular scales strongly keeled, slightly smaller than genials; scales on top of snout smooth except median row, which is keeled; scales on top of head heterogenous in size and shape, keeled; supraorbital scales keeled; canthus-rostralis and supraciliary edge sharp; a spine at the posterior corner of the orbit; two separated long spines on posterior end of head, the anterior slightly longer, midway between nuchal crest and tympanum, posterior above tympanum; orbit diameter 70% of distance between anterior border of orbit and snout tip; tympanum exposed, its greatest diameter 54% horizontal diameter of orbit; enlarged keeled scale between tympanum and orbit; posterior region of jaws swollen; supralabials 10/10; infralabials 9/9.</p>
<p> Nuchal crest well developed, composed of four primary, long conical spines, the first being the smallest and the third longest; the remaining vertebral scales slightly enlarged relative to adjacent rows and possess a more pronounced median keel forming a serrated ridge like the dorsal crest which continues till the tail base; 54 longitudinal scale rows around midbody; scales on dorsum keeled, oriented postero-dorsally, while lateral ones oriented postero-ventrally; lateral scales smaller than dorsal, keeled; ventrals strongly keeled, irregular, slightly smaller than dorsals but of similar size as laterals, genials and gular scales; a strong, oblique antehumeral fold, nearly extending across the throat.</p>
<p> Limbs slender and covered with strongly keeled scales, larger than laterals, forming parallel longitudinal rows; scales under thighs weakly keeled; length of hindlimb ca. 87% SVL; relative length of fingers 4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;5&gt;1; relative lengths of toes 4&gt;3&gt;5&gt;2&gt;1; fourth toe longer than fifth finger; 23 subdigital lamellae under fourth finger; 27 subdigital lamellae under fourth toe; subdigital lamellae with sharp keels, bicarinate; tail slender, swollen at the base; scales on dorsal and ventral surface of tail with sharp keels, larger than laterals; tail length 172 mm.</p>
<p>
<b> Colouration.</b> In life: dorsum and head blackish-brown with irregular lighter patches on the back; a light brown band from above the shoulder till the dorsal crest forming a ‘v’ shape; head laterally dark blackish with a white spot below the posterior end of eye; stripe from above nostril to anterior margin of orbit extending till the tympanum from the posterior margin of orbit in the form of a black band; tympanum pale grey, lip scales white; a blackish triangular patch behind the tympanum continuing to the antehumeral fold; ventral uniformly lighter, pale grey; gular pouch with a reddish stripe extending beyond the throat; tail with alternating dark and light blotches forming irregular bands towards the end. Representative image showing live colouration (Fig. 6b). In preservative: colouration pattern mostly similar to that in life, except overall paler; bands on the head dull greyish brown.</p>
<p>
<b> Variation and secondary sexual characteristics.</b> The other specimens examined agree with the CESL 0 45 in general morphology and scalation except for some differences that are summarised in Appendix 2 &amp; 3. All the examined female specimens (CESL 0 47, CESL 0 58 and CESL 061) have much smaller nuchal spines compared to the males, reduced postero-orbital spine; lack a dorsal crest and gular sac; overall colouration olive-brown, lighter head and vertebral region, a dark band along the side of the head to the neck and presence of a black antehumeral fold.</p>
<p>
<b> Genetic distance.</b>
<i> M. ellioti</i>
<b> comb. nov</b>. shows 1–2% intraspecific genetic divergence in the 16S gene; 4–7% interspecific genetic divergence from<i> M. rouxii</i>
<b> comb. nov</b>.; 5–7% interspecific genetic divergence from<i> M. acanthocephalus</i>
<b> gen. et sp. nov</b> and 4–8% interspecific genetic divergence from<i> M. montanus</i>
<b> gen. et sp. nov</b>. (Appendix 5).</p>
<p>
<b> Distribution.</b>
<i> Monilesaurus ellioti</i>
<b> comb. nov</b>. is endemic to the Western Ghats and is distributed across the low and medium elevation forests (up to 1000 m asl) of southern parts of central Western Ghats (Coorg plateau and south) and the southern Western Ghats. This is one of the most common evergreen forest dwelling agamid lizards in this region. During this study,<i> M. ellioti</i> comb.nov. was recorded in various sites in the central and southern Western Ghats (See Fig. 3 &amp; Appendix 1 for details).</p>
<p>
<b> Ecology and natural history.</b>
<i> Monilesaurus ellioti</i> is a diurnal lizard, semi-arboreal to arboreal in habit, and so far, has been recorded mostly in semi-evergreen and evergreen forests. Individuals were mostly seen perching on shrubs, branches and actively moving on tree trunks. In some instances, it has also been observed in coffee plantations surrounded by evergreen forests. In some sites like Parambikulam, Vazhachal reserve forest and Brahmagiri hills, it was observed to occur syntopically in the same habitat as<i> M. rouxii</i>
<b> comb. nov</b>., but more abundant within dense forests, while<i> M. rouxii</i>
<b> comb. nov</b>. is generally restricted to forest edges. In some instances, gravid females were recorded during pre-and mid monsoon (June–August), which hints that monsoon might be a breeding season for this species.</p>
