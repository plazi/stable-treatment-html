<i> Diestramima austrosinensis quaterna</i> ssp. nov.</h2>
<p> (Figs. 3–4)</p>
<p>
<b> Description.</b> Male. Body medium-sized. Fastigium verticis narrower than scape of antenna, divided into 2 conical tubercles, bases of tubercles drawn together, apices separated, obtuse, directing forward (Fig. 3A, C). Eyes oval, protruding forward; median ocellus oval, located between antennal sockets; lateral ocelli nearly circular, situated on lateral margins of conical tubercles of fastigium verticis (Fig. 3A, C). Apical segment of maxillary palp obviously longer than subapical one, apex inflated, globular.</p>
<p> Anterior margin of pronotum rather straight, posterior margin protruding backward; lateral lobe longer than high, anterior margin slightly oblique, ventral margin arc-shaped, posterior margin rather straight (Fig. 3B–C). Posterior margin of mesonotum protruding backward. Posterior margin of metanotum slightly straight.</p>
<p> Fore coxae with 1 small spine; femora unarmed on ventral surface, internal genicular lobe with 1 small spine, external genicular lobe with 1 long spine; tibiae with 2 inner spines and 2 outer spines on ventral surface, apices with 1 outer spine on dorsal surface and 1 pair of spines on ventral surface, between the paired ventral spines with 1 small spine. Middle femora unarmed on ventral surface, internal and external genicular lobes with 1 long spine respectively; tibiae with 2 inner spines and 2 outer spines on ventral surface, apices with 1 pair of dorsal spines and 1 pair of ventral spines, between the paired ventral spines with 1 small spine. Hind femora with 7–10 inner spines on ventral margin; tibiae with 30–31 inner spines and 34 outer spines on dorsal surface, subapices with 1 pair of dorsal spines, apices with 1 pair of dorsal spines and 2 pairs of ventral spines, interio-dorsal spine slightly longer than hind basitarsi; hind basitarsi with 2 dorsal spines (Fig. 3H).</p>
<p> Posteromedian process of 7th abdominal tergite long, surpassing apex of paraproct, the middle of posteromedian process slightly curved downward, apical area with 4 equilong posteromedian processes (Fig. 3D– E, G). Paraproct large, nearly quadrangular in lateral view, apical angle obtuse (Fig. 3G). Cerci slender, conical, apices acute (Fig. 3D–E, G). Genitalia completely membranous, with 8 lobes, apices of dorso-median lobe and ventro-median lobe with 1 notch respectively.</p>
<p> Female. Unknown.</p>
<p>
<b> Coloration.</b> Body yellowish-brown, with brown spots. Face with 4 longitudinal brown stripes, both sides of clypeus with brown spots. Apices of all femora brown, spines of hind femora and tibiae black.</p>
<p>
<b> Material examined.</b> Holotype: male, Longhushan, Shaowu, Fujian, 14 August, 2014, coll. Gang Wang and Huifang Guo. Paratypes: 1 male, Longqishan, Jiangle, Fujian, 9 August, 2014, coll. Gang Wang and Huifang Guo; 1 male, Ziyun, Mingjian, Fujian, 30 July, 2014, coll. Gang Wang and Huifang Guo. Other specimen: 1 male, Huangtanlinchang, Pan’an, Jinhua, Zhejiang, 28 July, 2015, coll. Chuan Wang.</p>
<p>
<b> Measurements (mm).</b> Body: ♂ 21–25.5; pronotum: ♂ 6.0–6.5; fore femora: ♂ 13.2–14.0; hind femora: ♂ 22.6– 27.8; hind tibiae: ♂ 23.8–29.6; hind basitarsi: ♂ 4.0–5.2.</p>
<p>
<b> Distribution.</b> China (Fujian, Zhejiang).</p>
<p>
<b> Discussion.</b> The subspecies differs from the nominate<i> Diestramima austrosinensis</i> Gorochov, 1998 in: posteromedian process of male 7th abdominal tergite with 4 equilong posteromedian processes. However, there is only the difference in character of apical posteromedian process of male 7th abdominal tergite between them, we consider it as a subspecies of<i> Diestramima austrosinensis</i> Gorochov, 1998. There is another specimen collected from Huangtanlinchang, Pan’an, Jinhua, Zhejiang, its posteromedian process of male 7th abdominal tergite with 4 posteromedian processes, the 2 dorsal processes shorter with the 2 ventral ones slightly longer, visible in dorsal surface. We regard it as an individual variation of<i> Diestramima austrosinensis quaterna</i>
<b> ssp. nov.</b> and provide its morphological photograph (Fig. 4).</p>
<p>
<b> Etymology.</b> Name refers to posteromedian process of male 7th abdominal tergite with 4 posteromedian processes, Latin<i> quatern</i> - means four.</p>
