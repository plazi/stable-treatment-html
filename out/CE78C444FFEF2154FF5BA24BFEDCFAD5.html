Compound spinigers in all chaetigers, with blade of two sizes, reduced in number in median-posterior region (Fig. 29A). Compound falcigers present only in posterior region, from chaetiger 112, one or two per chaetiger, with short blade (Fig. 29B), with triangular teeth, of similar size, distal tooth directed upward, proximal tooth directed laterally. In organisms with short size, falcigers present from first chaetigers (see notes on the development). Subacicular hooks with seeming unidentate (see notes on the development), with reddish basal end, distally translucent, starting in chaetiger 29 (Fig. 29G). In some of the additional material with short size, subacicular hook bidentate (Fig. 29F).</p>
<p> In specimen LACM-AHF POLY 6972, anal cirri without articulation; dorsal pair as long as last four chaetigers; ventral pair short, as long as last chaetiger.</p>
<p>
<b> Variation.</b> Material examined varied in the following features: L10= 1.2–6.4 mm, W10= 0.3–4 mm. Thirtynine organisms were examined, of which the smallest ones had not developed the palps (n= 6, L10= 1.3–2 mm), a single specimen possessed only the median antenna (L10= 1.2 mm) and in six adults the eyes were not observed. Palps reaching the middle of first peristomial ring or middle of the first chaetiger; lateral antennae reaching second peristomial ring or the middle of second chaetiger; median antenna reaching first peristomial ring or third chaetiger. Maxillary formula varies as follows: MII 5–7+6–7, MIII 6–8, MIV 3–5+6–9. The proportion of maxillary apparatus varies as follows: maxillary carriers with respect to the MI varies 1.5–2.7 times; closing system with respect to the MI varies 4.5–8 times; cavity opening with respect to MII varies 2–4 times. Branchiae from chaetigers 6–15 (R2= 0.7412, n=39; Fig. 30B) to 9–33 (R2= 0.8319, n=39; Fig. 30C). Maximum number of branchial filaments varied from 4 to 26 (R2= 0.8736, n=39; Fig. 30A). Well developed postchaetal lobe in first 7–74 chaetigers (R2= 0.60, n=36; Fig. 30D). Ventral cirri with a swollen base from chaetigers 1–6 to 9–71 (R2= 0.807, n=37; Fig. 30E). Start of compound falcigers in chaetigers 1–102 (R2= 0.867, n=29; Fig. 30F). Start of subacicular hooks in chaetigers 9–39 (R2= 0.8118, n= 39; Fig. 30G).</p>
<p> It was observed that in specimens with L10Ẽ 2 mm the compound spinigers were distributed from the first chaetiger to chaetigers 7–26; whereas in specimens with L10&gt; 2 mm, the spinigers were present in all chaetigers. Also, specimens with L10Ẽ 2.5 mm only have bidentate subacicular hooks; whereas, in specimens with L10= 2.6– 3.8 mm the subacicular hooks are bidentate in first chaetigers, and hooks unidentate in the median and posterior regions, excepting in posterior chaetigers where the hooks are again bidentate. Specimens with L10&gt; 3.8 mm have all hooks unidentate, except the most posterior chaetigers (growth zone).</p>

<b> Distribution.</b> Southern California, USA.</p>

<b> Remarks.</b>
<i> Paucibranchia disjuncta</i>
<b> n. comb.</b> has been recorded in Baja California, Mexico (Fauchald 1970), New Zealand (Knox &amp; Green 1972) and Japan (Miura 1977). The specimens observed by Fauchald (1970) and Knox &amp; Green (1972) match in terms of their branchial distribution, and shape and color of subacicular hooks. Due to geographical distance and ecological differences, the material reviewed by Knox &amp; Green (1972) may be suspected to belong to a different species. It is also necessary to review these New Zealand specimens to compare other features such as length of the dorsal cirri, the shape of postchaetal lobe, and maxillary apparatus, as well as, some size-dependent characters; this will allow for determination if these specimens belong to<i> P. disjuncta</i>
<b> n. comb.</b> or if they are an undescribed species.</p>
<p> The specimens observed by Miura (1977) from Japan differ from<i> P. disjuncta</i>
<b> n. comb.</b> because the former have dorsal cirri shorter than branchial filaments, and the shape of the chaetal lobe is rounded and short; whereas in<i> P. disjuncta</i>
<b> n. comb.</b>, the dorsal cirri are as long as the branchial filaments, and the chaetal lobe is rectangular and elongated. Furthermore, the specimens from Japan have pectinate chaetae with transverse distal edge, whereas in<i> P. disjuncta</i>
<b> n. comb.</b> pectinate chaetae have an oblique distal edge. It is necessary to review those specimens to confirm the differences; however, herein, the presence of<i> P. disjuncta</i>
<b> n. comb.</b> in Japan is considered questionable.</p>
<p>
<i> Paucibranchia disjuncta</i>
<b> n. comb.</b> resembles<i> P. cinari</i>
<b> n. comb.</b> by the presence of the spinigers in all chaetigers, falcigers only in posterior region in adult specimens, and unidentate subacicular hooks, reddish basally. However, as noted in the Remarks section of the<i> P. cinari</i>
<b> n. comb.</b>, the main differences between both species lie in the length of dorsal cirri in the posterior region, the shape of the chaetal lobe, and presence of eyes. The comparison with other<i> Paucibranchia</i>
<b> n. gen.</b> species having the compound spinigers and falcigers present is provided in Table 3.</p>
