<p> FIGURES 94-101. Pardosa zyuzini sp. nov. 94, left bulbus, ventral view. 95-96, left terminal part of bulbus in ventral (95) and retrolateral (96) view. 97, left male palp (patella, tibia and cymbium), dorsal view. 98, embolus of left palp, frontal view. 99, male metatarsus I. 100-101, epigyne in ventral (100) and dorsal (101) view. Scale lines 0.1 mm (94-98, 100-102), 0.5 mm (99).</p>
<p> Etymology. The specific name is a patronym in honor of our colleague and friend Alexey A. Zyuzin (Almaty) in recognition of his contribution to the knowledge of Palearctic wolf spiders.</p>
<p> Remark. The species described by Schenkel (1963) as Pardosa paratesquorum was based on a few males and a single female. The material originated from China (Gansu) and Mongolia. Schenkel (1963) explicitly selected a male as the type (= holotype), regrettably without locality information, and expressed doubts as to whether the female (from Mongolia) was conspecific with the described male. From the fresh material now available to us, and after examining a part of the original material of P. paratesquorum ( 1♂, 1 ♀), it is evident that the female is not conspecific with the male but belongs to P zyuzini sp. nov. as described here.</p>
<p> FIGURES 102-106. Pardosa zyuzini sp. nov., male (from type locality). 99, terminal part of left bulbus in ventral (102), retrolateral (103) and ventro-frontal (104) view. 105, left tegulum with tegular apophysis in ventral view. 106, tarsus and metatarsus of first leg in dorsal view. ba.pr, basal process of palea; cond, conductor; emb, embolus; pal, palea; stg, subtegulum; tg, tegulum; tg.ap, tegular apophysis; tl.ap, terminal apophysis of palea. Scale lines 300 μm (102-105), 1000 μm (106).</p>
<p> Diagnosis. Males can be distinguished from other members of the tesquorum group by long hairs on metatarsus and tarsus I (Fig. 106). In addition, males are distinguished by the widened embolus abruptly narrowing in apical part before truncate apex (Figs 98, 102), as well as the shape of the conductor and terminal apophysis (Figs 95, 96, 102-104). Females can be recognised by the amphoral shape of the epigynal septum, which fills out the epigynal cavities (cf. P. tesquorumoides) (Figs 22-23, 28).</p>
<p> Description. Male ( holotype). Total length 5.4. Carapace 2.85 long, 2.05 wide.</p>
<p> Prosoma. Carapace (Fig. 7) blackish-brown with yellowish narrow median band in thoracic part and yellowish unbroken lateral bands, latter often darkened and hardly traceable. Thoracic part with recumbent black pubescence, in median band in addition with whitish hairs. Clypeus yellowish, at least in part (more or less sooty). Chelicerae yellow, more or less sooty, with sooty longitudinal veins, retromargin with 2 teeth. Sternum sooty brown with narrow lighter streak in front (may be absent).</p>
<p> Eyes. Width of row I 43 (slightly procurved when seen from in front), row II 63, row III 85, row II-III 61. Diameter of AME 10, ALE 8, PME 23, PLE 18. Distance between AMEs 8, between AME and ALE 2.</p>
<p> Opisthosoma. Dorsum (Fig. 7) dark greyish-brown with yellowish lanceolate spot followed rearwards by a series of yellowish spots in pairs (often obscured), each pair sometimes joined to a transverse bar, each spot with a dark dot in the middle (pattern darkened and obscured in presumably older males). Venter yellowish to dark greyish with light recumbent pubescence and scattered, more erect dark hairs.</p>
<p> Legs (Table 1). Yellowish. Femora, except distally, more or less sooty, Fe III and IV sometimes with pseudoannulation. Patellae and tibiae sometimes with faint darker longitudinal streaks or blotches dorsally. Mt+Ta I with numerous thin, long, dark, erect hairs (Figs 99, 106), notably laterally (fewer of these hairs also present in Mt+Ta II). Ti I with one retrolateral spine in distal half.</p>
<p> Palp (Figs 94-98, 102-105): Pt 0.50, Ti 0.45, Cy 1.05. Palp dark brownish-grey, more or less suffused with black and with dark pubescence, patella dorsally largely yellowish brown; cymbium dark in proximal part, lighter distally (Fig. 97). Tegular apophysis stout, rugose, curved retrolaterad, with small but distinct hooked process basally (Figs 94, 105). Conductor prominent, terminating in a sclerotized process slightly bent forwards (Figs 95- 96, 102-103). Terminal apophysis directed obliquely ventrad, continuing into a sclerite that surrounds the conductor and extends backwards, ending in a sclerotized, triangular basal paleal process (Figs 95-96, 102-103). Embolus laminar, grooved, ventral edge turned forward; widening in distal half, then abruptly narrowing, tip truncated (Figs 95, 98, 102-104).</p>
<p> Female (allotype). Total length 5.3. Carapace 2.70 long, 1.95 wide.</p>
<p> Prosoma and opisthosoma (Fig. 8). Lighter than in male. Carapace brown with bright yellow median band distinctly widening in postocular area. Lateral bands bright yellow, jagged. Clypeus and chelicerae bright yellow, latter with thin brownish streaks. Abdomen with more contrasting pattern than in male. Palp yellow with darker blotches.</p>
<p> Eyes. Width of row I 41 (slightly procurved when seen from in front), row II 58, row III 79, row II-III 56. Diameter of AME 9, ALE 8, PME 20, PLE 16. Distance between AMEs 6, between AME and ALE 2.</p>
<p> Legs (Table 1). Yellow with dark streaks and blotches dorsally (pseudoannulation-like in femora).</p>
<p> Epigyne (Figs 22-23, 28, 31, 100-101). Comparatively narrow, with two separated anterior pockets and with amphora-like septum covering epigyneal cavities. Receptacles long, more or less parallel, with spermathecae ovoid (Figs 31, 101).</p>
<p> Size variation. Carapace length: males 2.50-2.95 (n=10), females 2.50-2.90 (n=10).</p>
<p> Habitat. In Mongolia the species has been collected in lake shores (lowlands below 1100 m), pebbly lake shores (highland 2500 m), pebbly river banks and adjacent overgrazed pasture, overgrazed swampy meadows, within stones in dry river beds, pitfall traps in forest opening (Marusik &amp; Logunov 1999).</p>
<p> Distribution (Fig. 116). Mongolia and Russia (Siberia: Altai, Tuva, Chita Area). This species may occur in China (Xinjiang), which borders Altai.</p>
